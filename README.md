# pyParser (By Sohum Trivedi)
A simple python parser that generates C++ from a basic grammar
See an example of the grammar in the "test.txt" file.
When main.py is run with python 3.6.1, equivalent C++ code is generated.
The Debug flag is set to True by default to allow the user to understand the various steps the compiler takes to transform the input to C++.
